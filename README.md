## Problem statement
How can we allow organisations to identify the suitable people to volunteer with them and allow people find the right organisations to volunteer with faster and easier by saving them time searching for an organisation to volunteer with.

## How it solves the problem:
Our website application (Web App) has many functionalities all which work towards the common goal of simplifying the process of getting into an organisation. There are two parts to how our website works. 

1. Part one is us reaching out to the organisation and asking them if they would be interested in working with us and being on our website. Once we receive the confirmation that they would like to be on our website we would ask them for what type of people they would like to volunteer for them. For example we would ask them for traits such as if they prefer working with humans or animals or if they are more introverted or extroverted. Once we have gotten their preference, we would add their organisation into our Web App and add their volunteer preference into the code of our website and update it so as to allow people to now be able to be chosen for the website if they are the type of person that the organisation wants.
  
2. Part two is on the user's side of things. When the user enters the homepage, he/she would see an Quiz button on the page and in the header bar, once selected, the user would be sent to the quiz page where they can take a quiz with the same set of questions shown to the organisations and once completed, we will show the organisations they are fit for and even rank them for them based on their percentage to what the organisation is looking out for. That way they can see what organisation they are best suited for.

## Main idea
The main idea of the app is to allow organisations to identify suitable people to volunteer with them and allow people to identify the right organisations to volunteer with to make a more cohesive volunteering experience. The app will allow individuals to take a quiz to analyse their skills and allocate them to a social service they are best suited to volunteer with.
